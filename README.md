# My Web Portfolio

Hello,

I'm David, welcome to my portofolio's github repo! This is a project I build in [React](https://reactjs.org). I'm using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as my package manager and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling. This project will be updated over time in the [development](https://github.com/davips96/web-portfolio/tree/development) branch, and once I'm satisfied with the changes they will be pushed to [main](https://github.com/davips96/web-portfolio/tree/development) which in deployed on [my website](https://davidbechara.ca). I'm using this `README` file to keep track of my todos for the project. Feel free to look around and use anything you may be intersted in.

Enjoy! :relaxed:
